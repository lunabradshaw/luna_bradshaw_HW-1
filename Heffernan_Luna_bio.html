	<section><h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hello this is Luna. I am Bridgets daughter and i like to think i am a bit like her, her good parts that is. I have a cat named Minou and a husband named Brian. We love to spend our time watching Netflix and adventuring out when we are not in a pandemic.</p>
		    <p>My husband and i bought my Nannies home when she passed away just over 8 years ago, we enjoy working on our house and making it our own. I just renovated our front foyer, hung wallpaper, painted and i am in the process of building a bench.</p>
		    <p>I am so proud of my mom and her decision to go back to school at her age and just do all the things that she enjoys.
